/** My takeaways from the first lesson
1) My code will be contained in my own repositories.
2) When editing code I can create a pull request to recommend/share changes that I made to a copy of the original code.
3) In order to safely edit code I can create a branch of the original code, then push my changes to either my own copy of the code or 
   push it to the main file where everyone can see my changes.
